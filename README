No time to write a real README just yet.  This will contain the bare basics.


BUILDING
--------

Execute 'ant' in the top directory.  A file you can run will appear in
the launcher/build directory.  If you are a Mac user you will get a proper
.app bundle, everyone else will currently get a .jar file.
