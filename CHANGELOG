   New: Notes are now editable through the annotations tree view.

 Fixed: Adding a 64-bit integer actually added a 16-bit integer of the same kind.
 Fixed: Creating a sub-region caused the end offset to be one less than it should have been.
 Fixed: Filenames with a space were showing %20 for the notebook description.
