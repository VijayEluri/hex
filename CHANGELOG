Version 0.X (XXXX-XX-XX)

     New: Annotations not visible in the tree due to their parents being collapsed are now hidden from rendering
          in the viewer.
     New: Selecting an annotation in the tree will select the corresponding range in the viewer.

 Changed: Zero-width annotations removed as they were causing altogether too much trouble (e.g. when sorting a list
          of annotations, it's hard to know which one is first.)  The structure DSL is updated to not drop an
          array annotation in if the length would be zero, which was the common cause for it.

Version 0.2 (XXXX-XX-XX)

     New: Notes are now editable through the annotations tree view.
     New: It is now possible to delete a sub-region (it was possible using Remove Annotation, but only if there was
          a byte where you could select the sub-region without selecting an annotation.

   Fixed: Adding a 64-bit integer actually added a 16-bit integer of the same kind.
   Fixed: Creating a sub-region caused the end offset to be one less than it should have been.
   Fixed: Filenames with a space were showing %20 for the notebook description.
   Fixed: Overlaps were incorrectly detected when zero-length annotations were present, or when trying to add
          a zero-length annotation, where the zero-length annotation was precisely at the start or end of another
          annotation.
   Fixed: Sometimes on exit you would be asked to close a notebook you had already closed.
